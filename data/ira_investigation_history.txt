  "executive_summary": "An activation failure occurred for the device with MAC address 94AABBCCB626 due to an issue with the WebPA system. The device could not be found in WebPA, preventing a successful reset operation. The root cause was identified as a missing device registration in WebPA, resulting in reset failures and incomplete activation. The incident remains unresolved, with potential business impact including customer frustration and increased support calls.",​
